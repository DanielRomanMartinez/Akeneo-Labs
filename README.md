# Intro

This is a Wiki that will help to develop new things in Akeneo :-)

The official documentation didn't help me so much, so this is my new "Wiki"

## First steps in Akeneo

* [Install Akeneo with Docker](https://github.com/DanielRomanMartinez/Akeneo-Labs/tree/master/Install%20Akeneo%20with%20Docker)
* [Create an empty Module](https://github.com/DanielRomanMartinez/Akeneo-Labs/tree/master/Create%20an%20empty%20Module)
